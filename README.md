pdffoldersearch
===============

About 1.5 years ago I quickly hacked a little tool together that allows to search 
folders containing PDF documents for search terms in those PDFs.

It is currently being used to search a manual all at once that comprises multiple PDF documents.

There are quite some TODOs left since it was a really quick hack and not everything is optimal but it is usuable.
Feel free to clone it and use it and adapt it for whatever purposes you want. 
If you do, a little message is of course always appreciated.
